    "Paris is the most populous city of France and the 7th most dense capital in the world, with an estimated population of 2,187,526 habitants in an area of 105 square kilometres. As one of the most famous world centers of fashion, luxury, arts, culture, and finance etc, it welcomes people from all over the world every year. To rent or buy a property in Paris is not cheap. Paris ranks as the 5th most expensive city to rent, right after HK, San Francisco,New York City and Zurich. Whether we can still find some nice appratments with moderate rent prices in a convenient and conforatble neighborhood of Paris? The answer is sure, but we need a little time to do some research to find the right one we want.\n",
